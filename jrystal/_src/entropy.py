  r"""Compute the entropy corresponding to Fermi-Dirac distribution.

  The entropy is defined as:

  .. math::

      -\sum_{\sigma, k, i} [o_{\sigma, k, i} \log(o_{\sigma, k, i} + \epsilon) + 
      (1-o_{\sigma, k, i}) \log(1-o_{\sigma, k, i} + \epsilon)]

  where 

  - :math:`o_{\sigma, k, i}` is the occupation number
  - :math:`\sigma` is the spin index
  - :math:`k` is the :math:`k`-point index
  - :math:`i` is the band index
  - :math:`\epsilon` is the machine epsilon to prevent numerical instabilities.

  Args:
      occupation(Float[Array, 'spin kpt band']): The occupation numbers with shape (spin, kpt, band).
      eps(float): Machine epsilon to prevent numerical instabilities. Default: 1e-8

  Returns:
      Float: The entropy value corresponding to the Fermi-Dirac distribution.

Examples
========

In this tutorial, we provide a set of examples to help you get started with ``jrystal``.

You will learn how to create a crystal structure, calculate its energy given a plane wave coefficients, optimize the coefficients using both SCF and total energy minimization, and in the end, calculate the band structure.
